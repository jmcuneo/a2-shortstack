## Design Achievements

### Design Achievement #1:

**Last Name:** Sunku  
  
**Task:** Book a commuter rail ticket to travel from Worcester to Boston  
  
**Problems:** Need to use scroll bar to go towards the bottom of the page due to huge table size.
Need to type each part of name in a different form input 
instead should have just one input asking for the full name .  
  
**Comments:**  The color scheme is decent. A little javascript animation 
to the website would make it more interactive.  
  
**Future Modifications based on Feedback:** Next time onwards, I will try to ask only relevant 
info from the user and make it more compact. I will strive to add some form of animation to keep
the user engaged.

### Design Achievement #2:

**Last Name:** Fusha  

**Task:**  Book an Uber to travel from Worcester to Boston    

**Problems** Need to press on the drop-down menu and choose the transport mode,
instead it would be more convenient if the user could just hover, and it shows a list. 
Another possible thing, it could do is give a search option for the user. So as the user types
the transport mode, it auto populates making it much easier and convenient to choose
rather than scrolling through the whole list.  

**Comments:** Suggestion to stick the footer to the bottom of the page rather than it 
moving to the bottom as the table entries increase.

**Future Modifications based on Feedback:** I will strive to ensure that the footer sticks to the bottom of the page 
by making its position absolute rather than relative. I will work to incorporate interesting features
like search option in the drop-down menu.
