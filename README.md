## Car model form
The app enables users to fill in the car model and its inforamtion, and update them to the server. Every time the submit button is clicked, the inforamtion is updated to the server, and retrieved from the server and shown in the table below.

The table is formated with grid and flex. The rows are organized as grid, and each row is a flex element.
The information filling section is a form element with labels and inputs.
The expireation year field is derived from the year of production plus shelf life.



## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
Using a combination of pages and data forwording, I was able to make a table that always fetches data from the server and refresh on the screen.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Two users tried out the software. They are De and Dai. They both think that the UI is straightforward and easy to use, but looks bad. One of them said that it is a bit abstract, which is a bit surprising. I would probably make it look better and add instructions to the app based on their feedback.
