## Owen Lehane's To-Do List
Single Page application, no extra pages. This is a simple to-do list after a given example by prof, as my skills are still developing. Centered flex box with roboto font and a plain header with heaing. Added background as a jpg file from the internet, didn't come out exactly as expected but taught me how to add a background from the internet. The flexbox contains a bulleted list of tasks, with a hard-coded width of 900. Tried to make it wrap text but did not work out well.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Can always add, delete, edit, and highlight when complete (turning green) the bulleted list of to do tasks. Data is always displayed to the user and when the page is reloaded, it resets. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: The simple task would be create a to do list of each thing you have to do today. Students will repsond in such format below:
1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
