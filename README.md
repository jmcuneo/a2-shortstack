## To Do List
Manage what you tasks you have pending with my To Do List website. Add tasks and categorize them as low or high priority. Based on priority the program will either give you a 3 or 7 day deadline. Click the delete button to get rid of a task. I used a flex box to adjust my navigation bar. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page App**: You can see as tasks are added and deleted from the to do list all in the same page without refreshing. 
- **Delete Data**: Click the delete button to get rid of a task.
- **Deadline**: The deadline field is automatically calculated based on if priority is low or high. If priority is low, then deadline is 7 days from now. If priority is high, then deadline is 3 days from now.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Test - Troup**: He found the layout confusing at first since the to do list is the focus, rather than the button to add a task. He commented on wishing he could set his own deadline for tasks rather than having them be automatically calculated. He also said he would have preferred for the priority to be a drop down menu rather than something he would have to type in, since if he typed in something other than low/high the program would break. Based on the feedback, I would center the add task button and make the font for adding a task bigger to draw it more attention. I would also change priority to a drop down and add how deadline is calculated based on priority.

- **Test - Boafo**: She found the website easy to use and thought it functioned smoothly. She liked the colors and the format of the website. She was confused as to how deadline was calculated. Based on the feedback, I would allow users to pick between an automatically set deadline or one they can pick for themselves.
