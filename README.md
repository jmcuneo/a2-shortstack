## How many more credits do your students need?
This site takes in a students name, how many credits they have earned, and how many credits they need. Then it calculates how many more credits they need to graduate.

## Technical Achievements
I created single page app that provides a way to enter student data and displays server's data and the history of the data. This can be used so teachers or professors can reference the information if they need to.

I was able to impletent a way to delete any student in the list on the sever side. I added a comfermation alert to the user knows that they are deleting a student. 

I impletment alerts if the user was entering improper data and a check to see if they wanted to delete a student.

**Post Think-Aloud**
I think becuse the students are all working on the same level, they understand the project more than an average user.
These think-alouds would be more constructive with real users.
