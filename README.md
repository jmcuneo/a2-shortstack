## Average Grade Calculator

Link: a2-nicolasvalentino.glitch.me

This project is an average grade calculator. You can enter assignments in using their name, the points you earned on the assignment, and the total points you could have gotten on the assignment. The grade for each assignment is calculated automatically and is displayed in a new column. A delete button is also in each row, which can be used to delete an entry from the table. To modify data in the table, enter the name of the assignment that is already present into the same box used for adding new entries, then enter the data you wish to update the assignment with. The old data for that assignment will be replaced by the new data. The average grade is calculated by adding up the points you earned for each assignment, and dividing that sum by the sum of all the total points available for all assignments.

The CSS positioning used was a CSS grid. The font used was Lucida Console.

Note: If all assignments are deleted from the table, the average grade becomes NaN.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The app is a single page application that uses a form to allow a user to enter data (assignments and their grades) into the server. When the page loads and whenever new data is added or deleted from the table, the table is refreshed on the client side to show the updated data that is stored in the server.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: The app is able to modify data by entering the name of an already existing assignment into the new entry form and then entering the new data that should be inputted for that assignment.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Evaluation was conducted by another student:
    1. Chartier
    2. The user did not have any problems with the design of the web application.
    3. The user did not make any comments that were surprising to me. They made comments about the appearance of the webpage.
    4. I would change some of the CSS styling of the page to make it look better. One of these specific changes would be making the header go all the way across the page instead of it having a space between it and the edge of the screen.
