## Lucca Chantre To-do List
this is a to-do list with separate server side and client side javascript files, where server data can be created, edited, and deleted on the serverside through the cliient side. I used flexbox for my CSS styling. More details are in my technical achievements.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. I made it to be a to-do list 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Created a derived field called priority which gives special messages based on the first character of the input string. if it is between 0-9 then it will say high low or mid priority, and if there is not digit at index 0 it will say N/A
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Created list items can be edited (modified) and deleted, and not only will the changes stay in both the server and the client after new data is inserted, but editing an item will also edit it's priority field.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Styled content in various ways including: through multiple css selectors such as element, class, and index
- **Design Achievement 2**: Used flexbox to align items in a grid and center them
- **Design Achievement 3**: Tested my site with 2 classmates:

lastname: Huang
This user thought I could add a bit more for my css styles to make the site look better
This user said they did not like how I built the site where you need to put a digit in the input for priority
Based on this user's feedback, I would add more css styling and perhaps restructure my project to have another input field for priority

lastname: Lui
This user thought it was a bit annoying that the input field didnt clear after hitting submit
This user said they liked how the site looked, specifically the font
Based on this user's feedback, I add some code to clear the input field after the submit button is clicked
