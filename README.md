FOOD DELIVERY LOG
Over the summer I worked Doordash and Uber eats and logged my work in an excel sheet. I decided it would be fun to make my own system to log that data.

Technical Achievements
Tech Achievement 1: Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.
    This was the easy part as I could submit data to the server using a POST request. To maintain conccurrency on the client side, I created a function fetchItem that uses a GET request to get all of the data from the server to be displayed on the site.

Tech Achievement 2 : In addition to a form enabling adding and deleting data on the server, also add the ability to modify existing data.
    This was much more challenging. This functionalilty works with up to 2 entries stored. Unfortunatly I ran out of time before solving the issue with the edit and delete buttons not properly corresponding with the correct rows when there are 3 or more entries. The problem lies with how the IDs are handled. I will continue to try to fix after the submission deadline.

Tech Achievement 3 : Make 5 calcuations server side and display in number format: 00.00
    Initially I ran into some issues with only getting a whole number back or getting NaN back for some calculations. I was using parseInt instead of parseFloat which fixed the issue. I also learned to used .toFixed(2) to show only 2 places after the decimal.

Design/Evaluation Achievements
Design Achievement 1: User Testing
    Here are the tasks I came up with:
    Context: You are working for DoorDash/UberEats and want to log your delivery stats.
    Task: 
    Add an entry with the following stats:
    Service: Dash
    Date: todayâ€™s date
    Wages: $23.75
    Tips: $32.59
    Miles: 30.6
    Time: 137 minutes
    MPG: 27
    Gas Price: $4.74

    Read the calculated data the site displays in the green cells. Does it match the following expected values?
    Total: $56.34
    Gas Used: 1.13 gal
    Gas Cost: $5.36
    Income: $50.98
    Hourly Pay: $22.33

    You realized you put the wrong time in, edit the entry to the correct time of 127 minutes. Does it show the correct new hourly pay of $24.09?

    2. no problems with functionaility. 1 issue: 
    "Just went through tasks. Didn't have any issue with understanding the app. Pretty solid layout. Only thing that was unexpected was modifying data. I expected the current field to be modified or a modified tag to be placed near it to signify it was modified."
    3. This 1 issue was not surprising as this was a goal myself to add in the future. 
    4. I want the editing fields to be in the table and clear, but it was a little too complex for just 1 week.

    2. site froze after editing and deleting an entry
    "I think everything was clear and easy to use. My only comment is to increase the contrast of the edit text labels.
    I did have a problem (not sure how to recreate it, i think its how i describe it) where if i went to edit an entry, and then delete an entry, the site kind of froze. I couldnt save changes or clear entries until i reloaded the site ( but I dont think this matters towards getting points on the A2 assignment)"
    3. this issue is surprissing and I will be attempting to re-create it and find the problem. I did not experience any freezing when running locally.
    4. yes I plan on making the whole edit form more visually appealing, easier to see and use

Design Achievement 2 : Display the data in a table that grows in size with each entry, have the derived data be in different colored cells
    I used a table in html and in my javascript code added a new row each time an entry was added. I also added an if statement to assign cell colors to the derived fields.

Design Achievement 3 : Create a form to edit a row and remove the form when finished.
    To do this, in my JS code I create a div that can be added and removed when edditing data. There is a global variable that idicates if this form is present or not, which makes sure that multiple edit forms can't be added at the same time.
