## Workout Log
The application is a workout log. The user can log their workouts adding a title and a description for every workout. A user can then edit a workout and delete them.

I used flex boxes and invisible divs to handle the "page switching" in my applicaiton. I also utilized tables to show my data.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Utilizing multiple DIVs I create the allusion of a multipage applicaiton by hiding certain DIVs when they are not supposed to be shown. The user can "switch" screens. When this occurs one div appears and the others are made invisible

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1.) Moynihan
2.) The UI wasn't responsive enough when making actions. For example editing, creating or deleting a post
3.) That my overall design was simple yet did enough
4.) Add some kind of animation when clicking buttons to show that the action has been completed.
