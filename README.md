## Task List
This program is an implementation of a basic task list application. The application makes use of CSS flexbox so that it is visible on many different screen sizes. For this application, you can input a task, specify which class it is for, the due date, and whether it is important or not. Once added, the server will give it a priority rating from 1-4 based on the due date and importance (1 being higher priority, 4 being lower priority). From there, you can edit and delete tasks in the table by clicking the respective buttons. To edit a task, it will fill the fields with the data where you can then edit t and resubmit. To delete a task, click the delete button and it will automatically delete it.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page program that allows the user to submit data and always see the up to date state of server-side data. Any time data is added, edited, or deleted, it will send that request to the server and then update the data on the server and send a response immediately back to the client so they can see it updated in the table.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Have the ability to add, edit, and delete data from the server. For adding data, I used the POST command to signal to the server to add the specified data that was passed in. For editing data, I used the PATCH command which sends the new updated object to the server which then will update the object based upon the ID associated with it. For deleting data, I used the DELETE command which will delete the specified object based upon the ID associated with it.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Made use of a table with buttons incorporated into it for ease of access for the user. The table made use of multiple colors to enable the user to more easily read and understand what is in the table. I also added buttons for each task for editing and deleting so that it is easier for the user to complete these tasks instead of having to scroll through ID number or something similar to delete or edit a task.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Utilized a wrapper with a flexbox to enable the elements to change layout dependent on the screen width. For the section that allows the user to submit tasks, it will display the fields in a 2x2 layout for any screen widths greater than 800px. For ones that are less, it will then change the layout to 1X4 so the user doesn't have to scroll left. I did this by utilizing @media screen that enables when the screen width is greater than 800px. For the table, I have this set to width: 100% so that it automatically stretches to whatever the size of the screen width is so that it make the best use of space.
