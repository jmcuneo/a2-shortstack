## Your Personal Library

I developed a Personal Library website, where you can enter books you are currently reading and the track the progress of your books. I used CSS flex positioning for parts of my website. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page application, so both the form and results table are all on a single page and easily accessible to the user. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**:
    <u>Last Name:</u> Bajwa
    <u>Problems:</u> Esha really wanted to be able to update her progress on books, but was not able to due to the lack of a modify data feature. 
    <u>Surprising Comments:</u> Esha was able to enter some invalid input, such as a current page number that is larger than the total page count of a book. I did not realize that this user error may arise and that I should prevent it from happening for the best user experience. 
    <u>Interface Changes:</u> From Esha's experience, I should add more input validation, as well as a feature to modify data so users are able to mark new progress without having to add and delete data manually.

- **Design Achivement 2**:
    <u>Last Name:</u> Kale (note: not a student in class but a CS major)
    <u>Problems:</u> Neil didn't remember the author of his book, so he was frustrated that he was not able to immediately able to add a book without knowing the author name. 
    <u>Surprising Comments:</u> I was surprised by Neil's UX feedback. He mentioned how he didn't like the delete buttons and the color being green, as it is confusing that a green button would delete, even though the overall site color scheme is green. He also mentioned the input boxes could be aligned better. 
    <u>Interface Changes:</u> I could change the alignment of my input boxes as well as the color of the delete button to be red for better UX design.
