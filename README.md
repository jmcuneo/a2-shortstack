## Arrow Trials
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
This page has a short game, consisting of two tests.
Test 1: You are given a pattern of arrows (up,left,right,down). You must press the corresponding arrow key when the green arrow shows up, but do nothing when the red shows up.

Test 2: Similar to above, but you just need to press the corresponding key in time regardless of color. However, you have significantly less time per arrow.

If you want, you can adjust certain values for the tests. Changing it from the default values will allow you to score more.

Regarding the CSS techniques I used, I utilized a mix of classes, element categories, and id's to design my webpage.
