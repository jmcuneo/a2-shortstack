Project Management Application

My application is a simple way for users to keep track of the projects they are working on. 
They can add a project by send its name, number of (total) teammates on the project,
and how many points the project is worth. The server-side code will add a field keeping track of
how many points each teammate is responsible to earn. For example, in a project worth 100 points with 4 teammates,
each person will be responsible for contributing the equivalent of 25 points to the project.
Projects can also be removed when completed by submitting their name into the remove project form
For the layout, I used a CSS grid, and also spaced elements primarily with percentages, to make the design 
as responsive as possible. 

This assignment was definitely more challenging than A1. I tried to apply as many concepts as I could from the readings,
but there were a lot and got hard to keep track of. The biggest challenge for me was learning how to use Node.js in tandem 
with server-side javascript code. I have experience with this in Java, and learned the basics of GET and POST requests in my 
software engineering course. This assignment was challenging because I do not have any javascript experience, and very little 
HTML/CSS, so it felt like I was learning a million things at a time. I took my time with this assignment, and I learned a lot.
