Design Achievements for A2:


Single-page App:

Entering the appropriate information in all three fields on the webpage will create a new filed derived from
Score / time, which is calculated on the server and shown immediately on the client.


Modifying Existing Data:

Entering a name that already exists on the table in the username filed
will update their existing information, except for the date (which was an intentional choice)


Web Testing with other students:

Brandon Lui: Commented on the fact that I had pre-entered values and could change them to be in the background of the text that way
when you click on the input fields they are empty but still tell you what they are for

Jayson Caissie: Found a bug that when editing information that the Score / Time filed did not round ot one decimal place (this has been fixed)
